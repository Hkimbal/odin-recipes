        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 
                350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, dip shrimp into beaten 
                egg, allowing any excess egg to drip back into 
                the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both 
                sides. Place the breaded shrimp, unstacked, onto
                a plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
            <li>Lower breaded shrimp carefully into preheated 
                oil in batches. Fry until crispy and golden brown, 
                about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined 
                plate to drain. Repeat with remaining breaded shrimp.</li>
        </ol>
